  This is the program for the problem'Pyramid'in ACM-ICPC world-final 2011.
  I use 'DFS' to realise the problem and the program can work very quickly.By using UVA online judge system,the program can finish the judge 
with 0.0000ms.At the same time,it is the NO.2 and my username in UVA-OJ is 'hide on bush'.
